# NeuroCore Documentation Index

## 📖 Overview

This directory contains the complete documentation for the NeuroCore system.

The documentation is organized to reflect how the system is actually built and used:

- Vision (what and why)
- Architecture (how it works)
- Execution & Core Systems (how it behaves)
- Distributions (user-facing systems)
- Infrastructure (environment and layout)
- Development & Operations
- Build History (full evolution of the system)

## 💡 Final Note

This repository reflects a real system under active development.

Documentation is:

- structured  
- layered  
- aligned with actual system behavior  

This is not theoretical.

This is a working platform being built in real time.
