# Argus – ACLI (Argus Command Line Interface) Specification

---

# What This Is

ACLI defines how users interact with Argus.

It is not a separate system.

It is:

> A constrained interface layer that exposes NeuroCore as the Argus distribution

ACLI exists to make Argus usable in real environments while keeping all behavior inside NeuroCore rules.

---

# Core Principle

ACLI does not create new capabilities.

It exposes existing Argus capabilities through a controlled interface.

All behavior still flows through:

daemon → runtime_manager → control_plane

ACLI does not bypass the runtime.  
ACLI does not execute commands directly.  
ACLI does not introduce a parallel system.

---

# Naming

The command name is not fixed.

Examples:

- argus
- acli
- user-defined aliases

The binary name does not change behavior.

---

# Role of ACLI

ACLI is the user-facing entry point for the Argus distribution.

Its job is to:

- accept user requests
- frame those requests correctly
- route them through NeuroCore
- return structured, human-readable output

ACLI should feel simple to use, but it must remain tightly constrained underneath.

---

# Supported Operation Styles

ACLI supports two styles of interaction.

---

## 1. Command Style

Single-command execution for fast diagnostics and normal operational use.

### Examples

```bash
argus summary
argus diagnose nginx
argus logs ssh
argus network
argus disk
```

### Purpose

Used for:

- quick checks
- direct troubleshooting
- normal production and homelab support work

---

## 2. Interactive Style

Persistent session for iterative troubleshooting and follow-up questions.

### Example

```bash
argus
```

Then:

```bash
> what is wrong with nginx
> what log did you check
> explain that error
> what would you recommend next
```

### Purpose

Used for:

- deeper investigation
- follow-up clarification
- guided troubleshooting in training environments

---

# Personality Model

Argus uses one command interface, but behavior changes based on the installed distribution context.

This is not a separate system.

It is:

> One Argus interface with different personalities

Same capabilities.  
Same tools.  
Same runtime.  
Different behavior style.

---

## 1. Production Personality

This is the standard Argus behavior for real Linux systems.

Used for:

- SMB environments
- homelabs
- customer systems
- operational troubleshooting

### Goal

Help the user understand the problem and fix it quickly.

### Behavior

Argus should:

- explain the issue clearly
- state where it looked
- describe what it found
- recommend a fix
- answer follow-up questions

### Tone

- direct
- professional
- efficient
- human-readable

### Output Expectations

Production Argus should provide both:

- conceptual explanation
- practical next steps

That means it may say:

- what the problem is
- why it believes that
- which logs or system areas were checked
- what fix is recommended
- which commands may be used to verify or resolve the issue

### Example Behavior

A good response might include:

- “nginx is failing because the configuration test is not passing”
- “I checked the service status and the recent nginx logs”
- “The failure appears tied to an invalid directive in the config”
- “Review the nginx config test output and correct the invalid line”
- “You can verify with `nginx -t` and then restart the service once the config passes”

Production Argus should be helpful without becoming a teaching system by default.

---

## 2. Training Personality

This behavior exists only when Argus is installed as part of the training environment.

Used for:

- lab scenarios
- guided troubleshooting
- skill development
- scenario coaching

### Goal

Teach the user how to troubleshoot correctly without immediately taking over.

### Behavior

Training Argus should:

- describe symptoms
- recommend where to look
- encourage logical investigation
- let the user work independently first

### Default Posture

Training Argus is passive by default.

It does not interrupt.  
It does not force hints.  
It does not immediately reveal the answer.

Instead, it behaves like:

> A senior administrator mentoring the user through the problem

### Guidance Flow

#### First Response

Training Argus should begin with:

- symptom framing
- likely investigation areas
- suggested commands or places to inspect
- encouragement to think through the system

Example style:

- “The symptom points to a service-level failure”
- “Start by checking the service status and recent logs”
- “Look at what changed between expected behavior and actual behavior”

#### Follow-Up Guidance

If the user asks for more help, Argus becomes more specific.

It may then provide:

- narrower investigation path
- interpretation of errors
- explanation of command results
- stronger hints

#### Full Coaching Mode

If the user appears frustrated, says they give up, or clearly has no path forward, Argus shifts into full coaching.

At that point it should provide:

- step-by-step troubleshooting guidance
- explanation of each step
- reassurance and mentoring tone
- full resolution path
- reasoning behind the fix

This is not just “the answer.”

It should feel like an experienced admin saying:

- what to do
- why to do it
- what to expect
- how to recognize success

---

# Distribution Availability

Personality availability depends on how Argus is installed.

---

## Standalone Argus Install

Available personality:

- production

Not included:

- training personality
- scenario tracking behavior
- lab coaching workflow

---

## Training Environment Install

Available personalities:

- training (default)
- production (optional switch)

This allows a training user to:

- use mentoring behavior by default
- switch to production-style behavior when desired

---

# Command Structure

Commands follow a simple pattern:

```bash
argus <action> <target>
```

Examples:

```bash
argus summary
argus diagnose nginx
argus logs ssh
argus service nginx
argus network
argus disk
```

The exact command name may vary, but the interaction pattern stays the same.

---

# Input Handling

ACLI must support:

---

## Direct Input

```bash
argus diagnose nginx
```

---

## Interactive Input

```bash
argus
> diagnose nginx
> what did you find
> what should I check next
```

---

## Piped Input (Future Support)

```bash
journalctl -xe | argus
```

This should be treated as structured diagnostic input, not raw chat text.

---

# Output Requirements

All ACLI output must be:

- structured
- readable
- grounded in real findings
- concise but useful

---

## Output Must Include

Where appropriate, output should include:

- issue summary
- where Argus looked
- what it found
- why the finding matters
- recommended next steps

---

## Output Must NOT Be

- raw command dumps without interpretation
- unexplained log blocks
- vague AI-style filler
- generic advice disconnected from findings

Argus must never expose raw output without making it understandable.

---

# Capability Expectations

ACLI should expose Argus capabilities such as:

- system summary
- service inspection
- recent error analysis
- log review
- disk usage analysis
- network inspection
- file discovery
- safe config reading

Capability scope is defined by the Argus tool blueprint and tool manifest.

ACLI is the interface.  
It is not the capability source.

---

# Execution Constraints

ACLI must always respect Argus constraints.

---

## Read-Only Enforcement

ACLI must never:

- modify files
- restart services automatically
- change configuration
- execute destructive commands

---

## Controlled Execution

All system access must:

- pass through the control plane
- use approved tool interfaces
- remain observable
- remain predictable

---

## No Direct System Access

ACLI must not:

- shell out directly outside the tool system
- bypass NeuroCore runtime
- introduce unmanaged execution paths

---

# Question Handling

Users must be able to ask follow-up questions in both personalities.

Examples:

- “What log did you check?”
- “Why do you think that is the issue?”
- “Explain that error in plain English”
- “What should I do next?”
- “Can you walk me through it?”

In production personality, follow-up questions improve clarity and speed.

In training personality, follow-up questions drive mentoring depth.

---

# Relationship to Training System

Inside the training environment, ACLI becomes part of the scenario experience.

It may be used to:

- observe troubleshooting flow
- provide hints
- escalate guidance
- support end-of-scenario review

Training-specific session analysis belongs to the training platform, but ACLI is one of the main user-facing touchpoints.

---

# Future Session Integration

In training environments, ACLI should later support integration with session tracking.

This may include:

- commands executed
- sequence of investigation
- time to resolution
- repeated mistakes
- areas where hints were needed

That data supports:

- performance summaries
- coaching feedback
- future scenario improvement

---

# Relationship to NeuroCore

ACLI does not replace the NeuroCore CLI.

The relationship is:

| Layer | Role |
|------|------|
| NeuroCore | platform |
| Argus | distribution |
| ACLI | user-facing interface for Argus |

---

# Final Principle

ACLI should make Argus feel useful immediately.

In production, it should help solve problems quickly with clear insight.

In training, it should behave like a senior admin mentoring the user through real troubleshooting.

Same system.  
Same capabilities.  
Different personality.  
Always controlled.
