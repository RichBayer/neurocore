# Argus V1 – Tooling & Capability Blueprint

---

# Purpose

This document defines:

* the complete Argus V1 tool set
* capability scope and constraints
* command-level implementation mapping
* dependency handling model

This document ensures:

Argus V1 delivers high value while remaining simple, reliable, and easy to install.

---

# System Definition (V1)

Argus V1 is:

A read-only system intelligence layer that analyzes Linux systems, identifies issues, and explains them in plain English.

Argus V1 MUST:

* use real system data
* provide actionable insight
* remain safe (no modification of system state)
* require minimal installation complexity

---

# Core Design Rules

## 1. Read-Only Enforcement

Argus must NEVER:

* modify files
* restart services
* change system configuration
* execute destructive actions

---

## 2. Local Execution Only

* no external APIs required
* no telemetry
* no cloud dependencies

---

## 3. Minimal Dependencies

* prefer built-in Linux tools
* optional tools must degrade gracefully
* installation must remain simple

---

## 4. Graceful Degradation

If a required binary is missing, Argus must:

* NOT fail
* return a structured explanation
* suggest the required package
* explain impact of missing capability

---

# Tool Classification

Argus tools are divided into:

## Tier 1 — Core Tools (Required)

* must work on standard Ubuntu/Debian
* no extra packages required
* form the foundation of Argus

---

## Tier 2 — Optional Tools (Enhanced)

* provide deeper insight
* may require additional packages
* must implement graceful fallback

---

* remove technical noise

---

## Recommended Actions

* suggest next steps
* never execute changes

---

## Executive Summary Mode

Example:

argus --summary

Output:

* simplified system health
* non-technical explanation

---

## Explain System Mode

Example:

argus explain

Output:

* inferred system role
* high-level system purpose

---

# Explicit Exclusions (V1)

Argus V1 does NOT include:

* automation or execution
* service modification
* configuration changes
* RAG / vector database dependency
* documentation drift detection
* monitoring integrations
* long-term memory
* multi-user support
* perception / home automation features

---

# Definition of Success

Argus V1 is successful if:

* users quickly understand system issues
* troubleshooting time decreases
* output is trusted and clear
* installation is simple
* system remains safe and predictable

---

# Final Principle

Argus should feel simple, but be powered by structured, controlled system intelligence.
