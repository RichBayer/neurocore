# Home Infrastructure Overview

> NOTE:
> This system was originally referred to as "Jarvis".
> It has since been renamed to "NeuroCore".

Owner: Richard Bayer

Purpose:  
Document the structure of the home computing environment used for the NeuroCore AI system, Linux practice environments, and virtualization lab infrastructure.

This file provides a quick architectural overview of machines, roles, networking, storage, and hardware expansion capability.

Build logs and detailed setup steps are documented separately in the respective project repositories.

For visual diagrams of the system architecture and hardware layout, see:

# Network Architecture

Primary connectivity is provided through Tailscale, creating a secure private mesh network between all machines.

Devices can communicate using either:

- local LAN IP addresses  
- Tailscale mesh IP addresses  
- MagicDNS hostnames  

Example SSH access:

ssh richb@lenovolegion  
ssh richb@linuxpractice
