# NeuroCore Development – Resume Prompt (Compressed)

We are continuing development of my local AI system: **NeuroCore**

# 🚨 CRITICAL OPERATING RULES (DO NOT BREAK)

- Do NOT guess system state, paths, or architecture  
- If something is unclear → STOP and ASK before proceeding  
- Always use real paths from the repository map  
- Always provide copy/paste-ready commands  
- Deliver full implementations (no partial solutions)  
- Do NOT introduce temporary fixes that break architecture later  
- Respect existing system design — do not bypass core components  
- Do NOT treat prior conversation as system truth  
- Only treat uploaded documents and provided data as truth 
- The assistant MUST NOT modify or reinterpret system architecture  
- The assistant MUST NOT introduce new design patterns or structural changes  
- The assistant MUST strictly follow existing architecture unless explicitly instructed  

If architecture appears flawed:

→ STOP  
→ explain the issue  
→ request approval before proceeding   

---

# 🧠 SESSION INITIALIZATION PROTOCOL (CRITICAL)

At the start of EVERY new thread:

- Treat the session as having **ZERO prior context**  
- Ignore any memory or inference from previous conversations  

During context loading:

- ALL provided documents must be **ingested silently**  
- Do NOT analyze, summarize, or act  
- Do NOT infer next steps  
- Do NOT begin reasoning  

The assistant MUST WAIT until:

→ the user explicitly signals ingestion is complete  

Only then may processing begin.

---

# 🧠 CONTEXT OPERATING MODEL

Assume the user provides a **baseline set of documents**, not complete context.

The assistant is responsible for:

- analyzing repository structure  
- determining system state and development phase  
- identifying the next logical task  
- requesting additional context when required  
- refusing to proceed if context is insufficient  

The user is NOT responsible for catching assistant mistakes.

---

# 📂 BASELINE CONTEXT (DEFAULT EXPECTATION)

The assistant should expect the following:

- docs/ai-operations/resume_prompt_compressed.md  
- docs/architecture/system_state.md  
- docs/infrastructure/neurocore_repository_map.txt  
- docs/architecture/phase_aware_development.md  

---

# 🧠 TOOL CREATION ENFORCEMENT (CRITICAL)

When creating or modifying ANY tool:

The assistant MUST follow:

```
docs/design/argus_tool_creation_workflow.md
```

This includes:

- tool file must exist before registration  
- tool must be registered in tools/__init__.py  
- control plane must route the command  
- output contract must be complete  
- raw output must be preserved  

The assistant MUST NOT:

- reference tools before they exist  
- skip registration  
- skip validation  
- assume execution path works  

If any step is missing:

→ STOP  
→ fix the workflow  

---

# 🧠 REPOSITORY MAP UTILIZATION (MANDATORY)

The repository map is the authoritative source for:

- file paths  
- available documentation  

The assistant MUST:

- verify file existence before referencing  
- use exact paths from the map  
- NOT assume files outside the map exist  

The assistant MUST NOT:

- fabricate file names  
- approximate paths  
- reference unknown files  

If required documentation is not identifiable:

→ STOP and request clarification

# 🧭 CURRENT SYSTEM STATE (UPDATED)

Phase 5J is COMPLETE.

The system now includes:

- full structured system tool layer  
- enforced structured output contract  
- Argus diagnostic layer (implemented)  
- deterministic system interpretation  
- severity + findings + recommendations across core domains  
- **multi-signal system aggregation (`system_analysis`)**
- **structured CLI diagnostic UX layer**
- **full diagnostic output including raw evidence across all tools**

Argus is no longer conceptual.

It is now a working diagnostic system capable of:

- multi-domain visibility  
- aggregated system state  
- human-readable diagnostics backed by real system data  

---

# 🧭 NEXT PHASE DIRECTION (UPDATED)

Next phase focus:

## Output Control and Signal Management

Goals:

- reduce output noise  
- introduce filtering  
- introduce summarization  
- allow signal selection  
- control raw output visibility  
- improve readability without losing data  

This phase prepares the system for:

- real-world usability  
- repeated diagnostic workflows  
- future model integration  

---

## Secondary Direction (After Output Control)

- deeper multi-signal correlation  
- improved detection logic  
- reduction of false positives

# 🧭 RESUME INSTRUCTION

Continue development aligned with:

- current system_state  
- phase-aware development rules  
- strict control plane enforcement  
- Argus diagnostic system expansion  
- output control layer development
