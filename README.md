# NeuroCore

NeuroCore is a controlled AI platform designed to understand and interact with real Linux environments.

Most AI systems today focus on making models smarter.

NeuroCore takes a different approach.

Instead of relying on the model alone, it defines how intelligence is applied — what data is used, what actions are allowed, and how results are produced.

It acts as a control layer between AI and real Linux environments, ensuring that analysis is grounded in actual system data and constrained by clear rules.

The result is simple:

less guessing  
more signal  
and outputs you can actually trust

---

## Argus (ACLI)

A product built on NeuroCore, designed to eliminate frustration and confusion and help you understand what’s actually happening in your Linux environment.

### Reduce downtime and understand your Linux environment faster

Argus takes simple commands, extracts real data from your environment, interprets it, and tells you what’s wrong in a human-readable format.

It reduces the time between:

something breaking…  
and you knowing exactly why.

---

## What is this?

I built this because I got tired of two things.

System tools give you raw data with no explanation.  
AI tools can talk all day but don’t actually understand your system.

Argus is my answer to that.

At its core, it takes real, structured data from your machine and explains what’s actually going on.

Not guesses. Not generic advice.

It sees your system — CPU, memory, disk, network — and interprets it in context.

You ask something simple like:

    ai "summary"

…and instead of digging through commands and logs, you get a clear answer about your system state and what to do next.

---

## Built for real systems

This runs locally on your machine.

No cloud.  
No sending logs or system data anywhere.  
No pasting sensitive output into a chatbot.

Everything Argus sees comes directly from your system — and every action is controlled.

This isn’t an AI running wild on your machine. It’s a structured, controlled way to understand it.

---

## What does it feel like to use?

You run:

    ai "summary"
    ai "How is my system doing?"

On a healthy system:

![System Summary OK](docs/screenshots/argus-system-summary/06_intelligent_summary.png)

System Summary

Severity: OK

Findings:  
All system data sources returned successfully  

Recommendations:  
None  

---

Now here’s what happens when things go sideways. This tool is active and usable in Argus today.

I pushed the system under load using a simple stress test. Argus picked it up immediately:

![System Summary Critical](docs/screenshots/argus-system-summary/07_high_load_test.png)

System Summary [CRITICAL]

Findings:  
Very high system load (4.13)  
Memory usage is normal  
Disk usage is normal  

Recommended Actions:  
Investigate CPU-intensive processes (use: ai "processes")

---

Then I stopped the load.

Instead of instantly flipping back to “OK,” Argus reflects reality.

System load decays over time, and it tracks that:

![System Summary Warning](docs/screenshots/argus-system-summary/08_load_decay_initial.png)

System Summary [WARNING]

Findings:  
Elevated system load (2.9)  
Memory usage is normal  
Disk usage is normal  

Recommended Actions:  
Monitor system load and identify heavy processes  

---

A little later:

System Summary [OK]

Findings:  
System load is normal (0.45)  
Memory usage is normal  
Disk usage is normal  

---

That’s the whole point of this project.

It’s not just running commands.  
It’s understanding system behavior over time.

---

## Who this is for

This is especially useful if:

- you don’t have a full-time admin watching everything  
- you’re running systems where downtime costs time and money  
- you need to understand issues quickly without digging through logs for hours  

Startups, small teams, homelabs, or anyone wearing multiple hats — this is built for that reality.

---

## What’s actually happening under the hood?

Argus looks at your system as a whole.

CPU. Memory. Disk. Network.

It pulls real data, combines it, and asks:

What matters here?  
Is anything wrong?  
What should the user check next?

And then it answers those questions directly.

---

## Where it’s at right now

This is V1, and it’s actively being built.

Right now:

- System Summary is implemented and sets the pattern for all Argus tools  
- Multi-signal system analysis is working  
- Output is structured, readable, and grounded in real data  
- It reacts correctly to real system conditions  

In progress:

- Expanding Argus across more system areas (processes, logs, network, etc.)  
- Reducing output noise (some commands still return a lot of raw data)  
- Adding filtering and summarization  
- Improving the CLI experience  

---

## What’s coming next

Right now, Argus tells you what’s happening.

Soon, it will also remember what *keeps happening*.

Not vague “AI memory”… real operational history.

So instead of:

“nginx is down”

You’ll get:

“this is the third time nginx has gone down in 14 days”

That’s the difference between reacting to issues… and understanding your system.

---

## Where this goes long term

Argus won’t just be trained on documentation.

It will be trained on real systems.

I’m building a controlled lab environment where I can:

- inject failures  
- break services  
- simulate hundreds of real-world issues  

…and train Argus to troubleshoot them correctly.

Not theoretically.

Practically.

---

## Supported environments (current)

Initial support is focused on:

Ubuntu (Linux)

That’s the primary environment for V1.

Support for additional Linux distributions will follow once the core system is fully stable.

---

## What this is NOT

This isn’t a chatbot wrapper.  
It’s not a collection of scripts.  
It’s not trying to automate everything.

This is a system that helps you understand what’s going on so you can make the right call.

---

## Powered by NeuroCore

Argus runs on NeuroCore, a local runtime with a control plane and execution model that enforces how everything works.

Every request, every action, every piece of system interaction goes through a controlled execution layer.

Nothing bypasses it. It’s the spine that connects the brain to the system itself.

That’s what keeps this predictable, safe, and grounded in reality.

## Final thought

This started as frustration.

System tools don’t explain anything.  
AI doesn’t understand real systems.  

This is an attempt to fix both.

It’s not finished.

But it’s already doing something useful:

It takes a system that normally requires experience to understand…

…and makes it readable.
