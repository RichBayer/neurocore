# Build Log 022 – Structured Tool Contract Enforcement

---

## Overview

This phase focused on enforcing a strict structured output contract across the system tool layer.

Up to this point, tools were returning human-readable output, but the structure was inconsistent and not guaranteed. That works for CLI usage, but it breaks down immediately when you try to:

- compose tools  
- build deterministic diagnostics (Argus)  
- introduce memory or model reasoning later  

So the goal here was simple:

> Make every tool return predictable, machine-readable data — no exceptions.

---

## The Problem

After updating `BaseTool.build_result()` to require a `data` field, the system immediately started failing on execution.

Example:

![Disk Failure](../docs/screenshots/structured-tool-contract/01_disk_command_failure.png)

And again with another tool:

![Layout Failure](../docs/screenshots/structured-tool-contract/02_layout_command_failure.png)

Error:

~~~text
BaseTool.build_result() missing 1 required positional argument: 'data'
~~~

---

## What This Actually Meant

This wasn’t a bug in the system.

This was the system finally enforcing correctness.

Every failure was pointing to the same root issue:

> Some tools were still using the old output format (no structured data)

---

## Investigation

We audited the failing tools directly.

### Disk Usage Tool (Before Fix)

![Disk Usage File Command](../docs/screenshots/structured-tool-contract/03a_disk_usage_file_command.png)

Scrolling down revealed the problem:

![Disk Usage Missing Data](../docs/screenshots/structured-tool-contract/03b_disk_usage_missing_data.png)

The return block was missing the required `data` field.

---

### Disk Layout Tool (Before Fix)

![Disk Layout File Command](../docs/screenshots/structured-tool-contract/04a_disk_layout_file_command.png)

Same issue here:

![Disk Layout Missing Data](../docs/screenshots/structured-tool-contract/04b_disk_layout_missing_data.png)

---

## Root Cause

After enforcing the new contract:

~~~python
build_result(status, message, data)
~~~

Any tool still using:

~~~python
build_result(status, message)
~~~

would fail immediately.

This exposed exactly which tools were not compliant.

---

## Implementation

We updated all affected tools to follow the required structure:

~~~json
{
  "status": "success",
  "message": "...",
  "data": {
    "raw": "...",
    "parsed": {...}
  }
}
~~~

### Example Fix Pattern

Each tool now:

1. Collects raw system output  
2. Stores it in `data["raw"]`  
3. Optionally structures key fields  
4. Returns a human-readable message separately  

---

## Validation

After applying fixes and restarting the daemon, tools executed successfully.

### Disk Command (After Fix)

![Disk Success](../docs/screenshots/structured-tool-contract/05_disk_command_success.png)

---

### Disk Layout Command (After Fix)

![Layout Success](../docs/screenshots/structured-tool-contract/06_layout_command_success.png)

---

## Additional Work (Full Tool Compliance)

Once the pattern was confirmed working, the remaining system tools were brought into compliance.

This included:

- `network_interfaces.py`  
- `network_connections.py`  
- `uptime_load.py`  
- `system_logs.py`  
- `users_sessions.py`  
- `recent_logins.py`  
- `service_manager.py`  
- `system_info.py`  

These were updated using the same structured output pattern.

No need to document each individually — the important part is that the entire tool layer now follows the same contract.

---

## Key Takeaways

### 1. Contract Enforcement Works

The system didn’t silently fail — it broke loudly and correctly.

That’s exactly what we want.

---

### 2. Runtime vs Code Matters

At one point, fixes were applied correctly but not reflected in execution.

Reason:

- daemon still running old code  
- Python caching behavior  

Restarting the daemon resolved this.

This is now part of the standard workflow.

---

### 3. Structured Data is Foundational

This change enables:

- deterministic Argus diagnostics  
- future memory system  
- model reasoning without parsing text  
- reliable tool composition  

---

## System State After This Phase

NeuroCore now has:

- enforced structured tool output  
- consistent data contracts across system tools  
- clear separation between:
  - human-readable output (`message`)  
  - machine-readable data (`data`)  
- validated execution across multiple tool domains  

---

## Next Phase

With structured data in place, the next logical step is:

> Expanding the Argus tool layer using this data

This includes:

- process-level diagnostics  
- disk analysis  
- memory analysis  
- multi-signal interpretation  

---

## Final Note

This phase wasn’t about adding features.

It was about making the system reliable enough to support real intelligence later.

Without this step, everything that comes next would have been fragile.

With it, the foundation is solid.
